            Andrew Fancher’s interest in WWII began when he was nine years old.
            While sifting through old family photographs, he stumbled on one of a
            young man in Army uniform. Handwritten on the back of this old black
            and white postcard was “Italy, 1945.” Andy quickly discovered this
            individual was his late-great grandfather, Gene T. Fancher. Being
            young, he had many questions regarding this individual’s service, but
            very few answers from the family. As it turns out, Gene shared no
            detail of his personal WWII experience before his early death in 1970.
            And so, because of the unknown, Andy Fancher’s curiousity in this
            momentous war began.
          </p>
          <p>
            He went online regularly and watched countless documentaries on the
            history channel. He realized the significance of our Allied powers’
            victory and knew we as a society were in great debt to these WWII
            veterans. However, Andy felt something was missing from society; the
            first-hand accounts of the men and women who lived it. In short,
            Fancher felt a calling to meet his heroes, and capture their stories.
            He created a Youtube page under his name and designated the project
            Andy Fancher Presents. One month into age 16, his first WWII veteran
            was interviewed. That was nearly two years ago. Andy is now 19, and
            currently pursuing a degree in broadcast journalism. He has spoken
            with WWII veterans from all walks of life, from all military branches,
            from all combat theaters. A handful of these 90+ year-old service
            members have become more than just his heroes, but family.
          </p>
          <p>
            Andy has attended book signings, birthday parties, routine lunches,
            car shows, and visits to the VA Hospital. Andy Fancher Presents has
            been featured on NBC 5, Dallas Morning News, FOX 4, CBS 11, and NBC
            National News with Lester Holt. Andy’s project has picked up great
            speed, and won’t be slowing down anytime soon. He will continue to do
            the best he can, with all he’s got, to preserve the fading stories of
            our greatest generation.
